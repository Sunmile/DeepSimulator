# Usage
## Prerequisites
1. Anaconda 2 or Minoconda 2 (https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
2. Downloaded Albacore (Suppose you downloaded: ont_albacore-2.1.3-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl: https://mirror.oxfordnanoportal.com/software/analysis/ont_albacore-2.1.3-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl)
wget https://apac.oxfordnanoportal.com/software/analysis/ont_albacore-2.3.1-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl

## Build a virtual environment for Albacore basecalling
```
<!-- This the python version should be the same as the Albacore you downloaded -->
conda create -n basecall python=3.6
<!-- Install the Albacore using pip -->
<!-- Make sure the .whl file is in the current directory -->
source activate basecall
pip install ont_albacore-2.1.3-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl
source deactivate
```

## Download the DeepSimulator package
```
git clone https://github.com/lykaust15/DeepSimulator.git
cd ./DeepSimulator/
```

## Build a virtual environment for the context-independent pore model
```
<!-- This step may take up to 8 mins since it would install all the dependencies -->
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Run a test
```
./main.sh -f ./test_samples/human_single.fasta
```
<!-- Remember to save the fast5 folder since it is consider to be a temp folder and overwritten every time you run the main.sh file -->

# Train customized model

## Simple example
Our simulator supports training a pore model using a customized dataset. An simple example, which only used the CPU resource, would be like this:
```
./train_pore_model.sh -i customerized_data/
```
Within the data folder, there are two kinds of data should be provided. The first kind of data is the sequence, and the second kind of data is the corresponding nanopore raw signal. Users can find an example of each file in the 'customized_data' folder.
After training, an model (three files, named "model_customized.ckpt\*") would be generated in the folder 'pore_model/model'. The user can rename the build-in model (named "model_reg_seqs_gn179.ckpt\*"") to a backup name and the customized model as "model_reg_seqs_gn179.ckpt\*" (all the three files need to be changed accordingly) so that the user do not have to change the code of simulator to use the customized model.

**Notice**: Generally, we do not recommend user to train a customized pore model because the data preparation and model training are quite time consuming and there might be some unexpected errors because  of the update of Tensorflow and the dependencies, such as CUDA and cuDNN, which notoriously annoying. We would make the model updated to the Nanopore technology development.

## Advanced
The above example only uses CPU, which would take years to train a model. To accelerate the training process and take advantage the computational power of GPU, users can consider using the GPU version of Tensorflow. User should make sure the following dependencies are installed correctly before running the training code on a workstation with GPU card.

1. CUDA (http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/#axzz4VZnqTJ2A)
2. cuDNN (https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn)
3. Tensorflow-gpu (https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux)

Users can refer to the Tensorflow website (https://www.tensorflow.org/) for more detailed instruction of setting up the environment.
